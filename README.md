This set of genomics scripts was developed by Matthew G. Johnson, post-doctoral research
associate at the Chicago Botanic Garden. Most scripts will require at least Python 2.7.3
for the use of the argparse module. Other prerequisites are noted in the header of 
the individual scripts.

I may decide to bundle these together into a more formal "package" at a later date.
